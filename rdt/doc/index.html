(RDT) Protocol</h1>
<p>The procedures you will write are for the sending entity and the
receiving entity. Only unidirectional transfer of data from the sender
to the receiver is required. Of course, the receiver will have to send
packets to the sender to acknowledge (positively or negatively) receipt
of data. Your routines are to be implemented in the form of the
procedures described below. These procedures will be called by (and will
call) procedures that I have written which simulate a network
environment. The overall structure of the simulated environment is shown
below.</p>

<p>The unit of data passed between the upper layers and your protocols
is a <em>message</em>, which is simply a 20-byte string. Your sending
entity will thus receive data in 20-byte chunks from layer5; your
receiving entity should deliver 20-byte chunks of correctly received
data to layer5 at the receiving side. You will not have to worry about
the encoding of this string, just use it as you would normally use a
string.</p>
<p>The unit of data passed between your routines and the network layer
is a <em>packet</em>, which is declared as:</p>
<pre><code>class Pkt:
    seqnum (int)
    checksum (int)
    payload (str)</code></pre>
<p>Your routines will fill in the payload field from the message data
passed down from layer5. The other packet fields will be used by your
protocols to ensure reliable delivery, as we’ve seen in class.</p>
<p>The routines you will write are detailed below. As noted above, such
procedures in real-life would be part of the operating system, and would
be called by other procedures in the operating system.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>rdt_send(msg)</code></strong>, where <code>msg</code>
is a 20-byte string, containing data to be sent to the receiver. This
routine will be called whenever the upper layer at the sending side has
a message to send. It is the job of your protocol to ensure that the
data in such a message is delivered in order, and correctly, to the
receiving side upper layer. Also, since this protocol is a stop-and-wait
protocol, you should only send a message if there is currently no other
message in transit. Just ignore the incoming message if that is the case
(this is why we use a large frequency).</li>
<li><strong><code>rdt_rcv(pkt)</code></strong>, where <code>pkt</code>
is an object of type <code>Pkt</code>. This routine will be called on
the sender when a packet from the receiver arrives, and on the receiver
when a packet from the sender arrives.</li>
<li><strong><code>timer_interrupt()</code></strong>. This routine will
be called when the sender’s timer expires (thus generating a timer
interrupt). You’ll probably want to use this routine to control the
retransmission of packets. See <code>start_timer()</code> and
<code>stop_timer()</code> below for how the timer is started and
stopped.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implementation-structure">Implementation Structure</h2>
<p>To accurately simulate the separation between the sender and the
receiver, you must implement your logic in two separate classes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>RDTSender</code></strong>: This class will handle the
logic for the sending entity. Its constructor will be
<code>__init__(self, udt, timer)</code>. It must implement the following
methods:
<ul>
<li><code>rdt_send(msg)</code></li>
<li><code>rdt_rcv(pkt)</code></li>
<li><code>timer_interrupt()</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong><code>RDTReceiver</code></strong>: This class will handle
the logic for the receiving entity. Its constructor will be
<code>__init__(self, udt, app_layer)</code>. It must implement the
following method:
<ul>
<li><code>rdt_rcv(packet)</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The simulator will create a separate instance of each class. This
structure enforces the real-world constraint that the sender and
receiver cannot directly share state, as they would be running on
different machines.</p>
<h2 id="the-simulator">The Simulator</h2>
<h3 id="interface">Interface</h3>
<p>Instead of calling simulator functions directly, your
<code>RDTSender</code> and <code>RDTReceiver</code> classes will be
provided with objects that represent the interfaces to the other layers
of the network stack.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your <code>RDTSender</code> will be initialized with two objects:
<ul>
<li>An instance of a <code>UDT</code> (Unreliable Data Transfer)
class.</li>
<li>An instance of a <code>Timer</code> class.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Your <code>RDTReceiver</code> will be initialized with two objects:
<ul>
<li>An instance of a <code>UDT</code> class.</li>
<li>An instance of an <code>AppLayer</code> (Application Layer)
class.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>These objects provide the following methods for you to call:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>udt.send(packet)</code></strong>: Sends a
<code>packet</code> into the underlying unreliable network. Both the
sender and receiver will use this to send packets.</li>
<li><strong><code>app_layer.deliver_data(message)</code></strong>:
Delivers a <code>message</code> string up to the application layer. This
should only be called by the receiver.</li>
<li><strong><code>timer.start(increment)</code></strong>: Starts a timer
that will generate a <code>timer_interrupt()</code> event after
<code>increment</code> time units (a <code>float</code>). To give you an
idea of the appropriate <code>increment</code> value, a packet takes an
average of 5 time units to arrive.</li>
<li><strong><code>timer.stop()</code></strong>: Stops the currently
running timer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="environment">Environment</h3>
<p>A call to procedure <code>tolayer3()</code> sends packets into the
medium (i.e., into the network layer). Your <code>rdt_rcv()</code>
procedures are called when a packet is to be delivered from the medium
to your protocol layer.</p>
<p>The medium is capable of corrupting and losing packets. It will not
reorder packets. The simulator is configured via command-line
arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>--nmsgs</code> (<code>-n</code>)</strong>: The number
of messages to simulate. My simulator (and your routines) will stop as
soon as this number of messages have been passed down from layer 5,
regardless of whether or not all of the messages have been correctly
delivered. Thus, you need <strong>not</strong> worry about undelivered
or unACK’ed messages still in your sender when the simulator stops. Note
that if you set this value to 1, your program will terminate
immediately, before the message is delivered to the other side. Thus,
this value should always be greater than 1. I recommend using a value of
N+1. So for example, 11 to send (and hopefully receive) 10 packets.</li>
<li><strong><code>--freq</code> (<code>-f</code>)</strong>: The average
time between messages from sender’s layer5. You can set this value to
any non-zero, positive value. Note that the smaller the value you
choose, the faster events will occur in the simulator. I would recommend
a really high number at first, even as high as 1000.</li>
<li><strong><code>--lossprob</code> (<code>-l</code>)</strong>: The
probability of packet loss. A value of 0.1 would mean that one in ten
packets (on average) are lost.</li>
<li><strong><code>--corruptprob</code> (<code>-c</code>)</strong>: The
probability of bit errors. A value of 0.2 would mean that one in five
packets (on average) are corrupted. Note that the contents of payload,
sequence, or checksum fields can be corrupted. Your checksum should thus
include the data and sequence fields.</li>
<li><strong><code>--verbose</code> (<code>-v</code>)</strong>: The level
of chattiness. Use multiple times for more detail (e.g.,
<code>-vvv</code>). The program uses Python’s <code>logging</code>
package. Various log messages are already set up for either the
<code>debug</code> or <code>warning</code> levels. You might find it
useful to add your own log messages for the <code>info</code> log level.
You should also keep in mind that <em>real</em> protocols do not have
underlying networks that provide such nice information about what is
going to happen to their packets!</li>
<li><strong><code>--pause</code> (<code>-p</code>)</strong>: The time
(in seconds) to pause between events, controlling the simulation speed.
Defaults to 2s for GUI/TUI, and 1s for terminal.</li>
<li><strong><code>--no-gui</code></strong>: Run the simulator in the
terminal with log output only, instead of the default graphical
interface.</li>
<li><strong><code>--tui</code></strong>: Use a terminal-based user
interface instead of the graphical one.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="graphical-user-interface-gui">Graphical User Interface
(GUI)</h3>
<p>By default, the simulator runs with a graphical user interface (GUI)
that visualizes the operation of your RDT protocol.</p>
<p>The GUI shows the state of the sender and receiver, including the
data at each layer (Application, Transport, and Network). It also
visualizes packets in transit across the network. Lost and corrupted
packets are colored red for easy identification.</p>
<p>The playback controls at the top allow you to: - <strong>Pause and
Resume</strong> the simulation. - <strong>Step Forward</strong> and
<strong>Step Back</strong> through events when paused. - Adjust the
<strong>simulation speed</strong> with a slider.</p>
<p>The GUI is a powerful tool for debugging your implementation. You can
run the simulator in a terminal-only mode using the
<code>--no-gui</code> flag.</p>
<h2 id="helpful-hints">Helpful Hints</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Checksumming.</strong> You can use whatever approach for
checksumming you want (implement it as a method on the <code>Pkt</code>
class). Remember that the sequence number and ack field can also be
corrupted. I suggest a TCP-like checksum, which consists of the sum of
the (integer) sequence field value added to a character-by-character sum
of the payload field of the packet. I recommend using the Python builtin
function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ord"><code>ord()</code></a>
for this.</li>
<li>Note that any shared “state” among your routines needs to be in the
form of a data attribute on your class. Note also that any information
that your procedures need to save from one invocation to the next must
also be similarly maintained. For example, your routines will need to
keep a copy of a packet for possible retransmission. It would probably
be a good idea for such a data structure to also be saved as an
attribute of your class. Note, however, that if one of your data
attributes is used by your sender side, that variable should
<strong>NOT</strong> be accessed by the receiving side entity, since in
real life, communicating entities connected only by a communication
channel can not share state by some other means.</li>
<li>There is an attribute on the simulator object called <code>t</code>
that you can access from within your code to help you out with your
diagnostics msgs.</li>
<li><strong>START SIMPLE.</strong> First design and implement your
procedures for the case of no loss and no corruption (set the
probabilities of loss and corruption to zero), and get them working
first. Then handle the case of one of these probabilities being
non-zero, and then finally both being non-zero.</li>
<li><strong>Debugging.</strong> Use the logs excessively. You can
control the log verbosity with the <code>-v</code> flag. The simulator’s
GUI is also an excellent debugging tool. It allows you to pause, step
through events, and adjust the simulation speed on the fly. Slowing down
the execution, either with the GUI’s speed slider or the
<code>--pause</code> command-line argument, is very helpful.</li>
